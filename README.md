## Explanation of Key Sections

1. **Navigation Bar**:
   - A flexible layout using `flexbox` for positioning the logo, language dropdown, and sign-in button.
   - The `select` element allows the user to choose between English and Hindi.

2. **Hero Section**:
   - The large background image is set with the `hero-background-img` class, and the text is overlaid with a dark transparent layer (`hero-back-lay`) for readability.
   - The `contact-form` prompts users to enter their email to start a Netflix membership.

3. **Card Sections**:
   - Three informational cards showcase features like watching on TV, downloading shows, and watching on various devices.
   - The card design utilizes inline grids to align images and videos with text.

4. **FAQ Section**:
   - A collapsible FAQ list where users can click to reveal the answer. This is achieved by using radio buttons for toggling content visibility.

5. **Footer Section**:
   - A footer with legal, help center, and other informational links, styled using `flexbox` for a neat, responsive design.
